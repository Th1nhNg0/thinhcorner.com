### Analysis (step by step)

1. **How big is Vietnam’s exposure to the US?**

   * Goods the US bought from Vietnam in 2024 were **≈ US \$137 billion**. ([United States Trade Representative][1])
   * Vietnam’s 2024 GDP is estimated at **≈ US \$456 billion**. ([World Economics][2])
   * Therefore, sales to the US equal **30 % of Vietnam’s GDP** and **\~30 % of all Vietnamese exports**. ([World Integrated Trade Solution][3])

2. **What does a 46 % tariff do to US demand?**
   * Historical studies put the price-elasticity of US demand for similar imports around **-1.3 to -1.7**.
   * Using a midpoint (-1.5):

   * Price ↑ 46 % → quantity ↓ ≈ 69 %.
   * Export revenue falls from US \$137 bn to about **US \$42 bn** (drop ≈ US \$95 bn).

3. **How much of that revenue is Vietnamese value-added?**
   * OECD TiVA shows roughly **55 % of Vietnam’s export value is created at home** (the rest is imported inputs). ([OECD][4])
   * Domestic GDP hit ≈ 0.55 × US \$95 bn = **US \$52 bn**.

4. **Translate to GDP growth:**
   * US \$52 bn equals **≈ 11 % of Vietnam’s GDP** in one stroke.
   * Even if firms find other buyers and the volume decline is “only” 50 %, the one-year loss is still ≈ US \$38 bn (-8 % of GDP).
   * Applying a modest fiscal-multipliers/knock-on factor of **1.3** for layoffs, weaker consumption and lost investment, the full-year GDP impact ranges **-6 % to -14 %**.

5. **Broader side-effects (qualitative):**

   * **Jobs:** Electronics, apparel and furniture—the three biggest US-bound sectors—employ \~6 million workers; large layoffs would pressure household spending.
   * **FDI:** Many export-platform investors (Korea, Taiwan, China) chose Vietnam to serve the US market; some production may shift to tariff-free neighbours, stalling new inflows.
   * **Currency & inflation:** A softening đồng (to cushion exporters) would raise import prices for fuel, fertiliser and machinery, nudging domestic inflation up.
   * **Public finances:** Lower customs and corporate-income receipts shrink fiscal space just as social-safety costs rise.

### Final conclusion

If the 46 % US tariff stays in place, Vietnam is likely to slide from the **\~6 % growth path to a recession of roughly –4 % to –8 % in 2025**, wiping **US \$40-50 billion** off national income in the first year alone. Even in a best-case scenario (firms quickly re-route one-third of lost sales elsewhere), growth would slow to barely **1-2 %** and living-standards gains would stall. In short:

> **The tariff shock is big enough to knock a full decade of normal growth off Vietnam’s economy in a single year, unless it is softened or rolled back.**
