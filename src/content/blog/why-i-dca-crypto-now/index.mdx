A bread price was 15.000 VNĐ last year; it's 18.000-20.000 VNĐ now[^1].

What didn't change? My phone buzzing at 9 a.m. to say another 5 USD of cryptocurrency hit my wallet.  

Inflation can play whack-a-mole with prices; I'm busy stacking crypto.

## What I have learned

First we needed to know what is **fiat money**.

"Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Its value comes from the trust and confidence of the people who use it."

You see the problem?

Since it is not backed by a physical commodity, the government can print more money at will, leading to inflation. This means that the value of fiat money can decrease over time, eroding your purchasing power.

In worst cases, it can lead to hyperinflation, where the value of money plummets so quickly that it becomes nearly worthless. This has happened in several countries throughout history, such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela.

Hold your thought there, let take a look at **GDP (Gross domestic product)**.

**GDP (Y)** is the sum of **consumption (C)**, **investment (I)**, **government expenditures (G)** and **net exports (X − M)**.

$$Y = C + I + G + (X - M)$$

Where:
- **C** is the total value of all goods and services consumed by households.
- **I** is the total value of all investments made by businesses.
- **G** is the total value of all government expenditures.
- **X** is the total value of all exports.
- **M** is the total value of all imports.

*Note: This formula is using The Expenditure Approach to calculate GDP, which is one of the most common methods.*

A growing GDP indicates a healthy economy, while a declining GDP can signal economic problems.

Let take a look at GDP in Vietnam.

According to the Vietnam National Assembly, the GDP growth target for 2025 is set at a minimum of 8%. This ambitious target reflects the government’s commitment to driving economic growth and development in the coming years.[^2]

So what factor do you think will contribute to this growth?

Let first look at **Consumption (C)**, this value can only increase if the people buy more goods and services. In theory, there is two simple ways the government can help this happen: (1) Increase the income of the people. (2) Decrease taxs on goods and services.

With (1), it cleary to see that it impossible to increase the income of the people, mostly government employee. Because in 2025, Vietnam is processing through a new revolution to streamline the political system, which will likely lead to a reduction in the number of government employees[^4]. And the government has also approved a budget of 44 trillion VND (about 1.9 billion USD) to support the restructuring of the political system[^5]. There people now don't have a job to work, so they will cut spending on goods and services, leading to a decrease in consumption.

Now, let's look at (2). The government has indeed made moves here. For instance, the 2% reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT) for many goods and services, which was already in place, has been extended from January 1, 2025, through to June 30, 2025. This is a direct effort to make things a bit cheaper and encourage spending.[^6] However, look like the government is likely to propose extending this VAT reduction until the end of 2026[^7]. Seem like the tax reduction is not enough to boost consumption in the first half of 2025, and the government is looking for more time to see if it can help.

But at the customer side, it not just about the tax reduction. People are still feeling the pinch of rising prices, with many essential goods and services seeing price hikes[^1]. This means that even with lower taxes, people might not feel like they have more money to spend. 

Beside that, in the first four months of 2025, Vietnam has seen a significant increase in cases related to counterfeit and substandard goods. Authorities handled over 34,000 violations, with nearly 1,400 criminal cases and more than 2,100 individuals prosecuted. These cases range from fake food products, medicines, and cosmetics to counterfeit agricultural chemicals and even gold smuggling. Many of these operations were large-scale, involving thousands of fake products and millions of dollars in illicit gains. The widespread presence of counterfeit goods, especially on e-commerce platforms, poses a direct threat to public health and undermines consumer confidence in the market[^8]. With this in mind, the customers are likely to be more cautious with their spending, further reducing consumption.

> I also living in fear that I might consume some products that gonna make me regret later.

So it clear that the government is trying to boost consumption, but it is not working as expected. The people are still feeling the pinch of rising prices, and the government is looking for more time to see if the tax reduction can help.

Let take a look at **Investment (I)** and **Net Exports (X - M)** to see if they can help boost GDP.

I group these two factors together because they are both related to one thing: **Trump 2.0 tariff**.

On April 2—a day Donald Trump called "Liberation Day"—Trump announced a minimum 10% tariff on all US imports, effective April 5, and higher tariffs on imports from 57 countries. The announcement of these controversially named "reciprocal tariffs" prompted retaliation from trade partners and triggered a stock market crash.

![Trump with chart](./trump-chart-ap-jt-250402_1743626176335_hpMain.avif "President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025, in Washington, D.C.")

Vietnam is one of the countries most affected by these new tariffs, facing a 46% rate—among the highest announced:

- Cambodia: 49%
- Vietnam: 46%
- Sri Lanka: 44%
- Bangladesh: 37%
- Thailand: 36%
- China: 34% (in addition to existing 20% levies)
- Taiwan: 32%
- Indonesia: 32%
- Switzerland: 31%
- South Africa: 30%

Before going to how Vietnam government will respond to this, let's take a look at how this tariff rate will affect the economy.

This task is big, so I use some help from my friend, ChatGPT. Let's see what he said:
