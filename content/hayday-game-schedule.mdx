summary: A deep dive into the scheduling problem in the Hay Day game.

It's has beed a long time since my last post. I have been busy with my work. I was researching the scheduling problem in the Hay Day game for a while. And now is the good time to share the result with you.

## What is Hay Day?


Hay Day is a popular mobile game created by Supercell in 2012. It is a farming simulator where you can plant crops and trees, raise animals, sell products, compete in derbies, and so much more. Hay Day is a freemium game so all features of the game are open to players who choose not to buy in-app-purchases.

In Hay Day, your main job is to make products based on the orders that you receive from the customers. When you complete the order, you will get coins and experience points. The orders are generated randomly and you can choose to accept or decline them. The orders are combine of products that you can make in the game.

To make products in the game, you need two main resources: goods (or product) and machine. Each goods has a production time, a machine that can produce it and goods that are required to make it. For example, to make a _chicken feed_, you need _2 wheat_ and _1 corn_. The production time of a _chicken feed_ is _5 minutes_ and it can be made in the _feed mill_. And

## The problem

Hay Day is a really easy game, at least when I started playing. Wheat is planted, gathered, and sold. Alternately, you may use wheat to produce and sell bread. However, as the game progresses, you will acquire additional machines, goods, and orders.

As you can see, just in level 20 of the game, we have 40 goods and 10 machines. The permutation of the goods and machines is huge. At this point, the scheduling issue arises.

So what do we want to solve here? Let clarify the problem:

- An order is a set of goods that need to be made.
- A machine can only produce one good at a time.
- A machine can only produce a good if it has all the required goods.
- A good can only be produced on a specific machine.

Our target:

- Given a set of orders, find a schedule that maximize the **makespan** of the orders.
- The makespan is the time between the start of the first order and the end of the last order.

A simple scheduling to make a order with two egg will look like this:

But in reality, the scheduling is more complex. Here is the image showing the scheduling of 2 orders with 4 goods:

## First attempt

So how can we solve this problem? 

The first thing that comes to my mind is [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). 

The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by [Darwin's theory of evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism). This algorithm borrows the following concepts from natural selection:

- Each individual (solution) has an associated fitness score
- Individuals with high fitness scores are selected for reproduction
- Chosen individuals reproduce to create offspring with the characteristics of both parents
- Some offspring would have random mutations applied to them

The idea is that if the parents have high fitness, the offspring would have high fitness as well.

This entire process of **selection**, **reproduction** (more commonly known as crossover), and **mutation** will repeat many times. At the end, only the fittest individuals will remain. These fittest individuals represent the solutions to our problem.
